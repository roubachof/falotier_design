# Falotier Design

This is an implement of a design system with dynamic theming.

All the code has been shamelessly copied from github:
https://github.com/aloisdeniel/asgard_shop

This is the work of the brilliant Aloïs Deniel (https://github.com/aloisdeniel)

Please go watch his video on theming:

The lib is way more lazier than the original work since I am just basically modifying the material widgets.
Aloïs recreates all the widgets with proper visual states.
